# Issues in the Broken App

1. **Lack of Input Validation:** The original code lacks input validation for the `developers` array. It should check if the request body contains a valid array of developers and provide informative error responses.

2. **Missing Error Handling:** The code does not adequately handle errors. It should include proper error handling for cases where the GitHub API request fails or when there is an internal server error.

3. **Inadequate Comments:** The code lacks comments explaining its functionality and logic. It would be helpful to add comments to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. **No Dependencies:** The code does not list its dependencies, such as `axios` and `express`, in a `package.json` file, making it unclear what is required to run the app.

5. **Lack of a README:** There is no README file to provide instructions on how to run and use the app, making it less user-friendly for new developers.

6. **Inefficient Promise Handling:** The code could benefit from a more efficient way of handling promises, especially when making multiple requests to the GitHub API.
